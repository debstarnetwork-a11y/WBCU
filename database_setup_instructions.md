## 1. How to Save as a `.sql` File in Notepad

1. Open **Notepad** (or VS Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text).
2. Copy the entire SQL script from `cpanel_wbcu_database.sql`.
3. Paste it into Notepad.
4. Click **File** > **Save As...**
5. In the save dialog:
   - **File name:** `wbcu_database.sql`

6. Click **Save**.

## 2. Should you compress it into `.rar` or `.zip`?

❌ **NO, do NOT compress it to a `.rar` file.**
- phpMyAdmin **does not support `.rar`** files.
- You can upload the uncompressed **`.sql` file directly** (it is only ~21 KB and uploads instantly).
- *(Optional)* If your host restricts file sizes, only `.zip` or `.gzip` (`.sql.gz`) are supported, but for a 21 KB file, plain **`.sql`** is the standard, safest, and easiest format.
